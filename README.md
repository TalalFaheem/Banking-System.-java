# Banking-System.-java
This Java Swing project simulates a banking system with Admin and User login. Admins can manage accounts and simulate transactions, while users can deposit, withdraw, and view balance. It uses file-based data storage, multi-threading, and demonstrates deadlock handling in transactions.
